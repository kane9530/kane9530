- 👋 Hi there, I am Kane. Curently, I am a postdoctoral bioinformatics research fellow at MGI Tech Singapore, where I lead the development of computational solutions for our Stereo-seq spatial transcriptomics technology. In early 2022, I completed my PhD in Genetics at the University of Cambridge, where I studied cell-fate decision making in the tailbud of early zebrafish embryos 🐟. 
- 💬 In my spare time, I enjoy learning about causal inference and bayesian statistics, and keeping myself up to date with the rapid progress made in the area of generative AI.
